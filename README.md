## Description

For this assignment I built a weather app which will allow a user to look up the current weather and forecast for a city.

## Usage

- When the user opens the app, they can put in a city of their choice.
- When the user clicks search, they are presented with the current weather for the location and a five day forecast.
- the city is then stored in a list of recently searched locations


Please see screenshots below of the app in use:
